    <h1>ABOUT LA CONDESA</h1>
    <img src="img/condesa.jpg" alt="A photo of La Condesa Neighborhood">
    <h2>Considered the <strong>"HIP"</strong> Neighborhood of 2015</h2>

    <p class="intro">Next to Bosque de Chapultepec a nearby colonia known as La Condesa, filled with fading 1920s and 1930s architecture, sun-dappled parks, and a wide variety of eateries that cater to the city's young and trendy. The capital's elite were concentrated here at the turn of the 20th century. In the late 1990s a tide of artists, entrepreneurs, and foreigners brought a wave of energy. La Condesa and La Roma are a must-see in spring, when the jacarandas are in bloom.</p>

    <p>La Condesa is the more outwardly charming of the two, with a lively nightlife scene catering to the younger set.</p>

    <h2>WHAT TO DO?</h2>
    <p>The Condesa's nucleus is the restaurant zone (ask your taxi driver to take you to the neighborhood's zona de restaurantes).</p>
