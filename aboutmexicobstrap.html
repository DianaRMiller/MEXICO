            <h2>A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY (It never hurts to know!)</h2>

            <p>Mexico's capital is both the oldest capital city in the Americas and one of two founded by Amerindians (Native Americans), the other being Quito. The city was originally built on an island of Lake Texcoco by the Aztecs in 1325 as Tenochtitlan, which was almost completely destroyed in the 1521 siege of Tenochtitlan, and subsequently redesigned and rebuilt in accordance with the Spanish urban standards. In 1524, the municipality of Mexico City was established, known as Mexico Tenochtitlan,and as of 1585 it was officially known as Ciudad de Mexico (Mexico City).Mexico City served as the political, administrative and financial center of a major part of the Spanish colonial empire.After independence from Spain was achieved, the Federal District was created in 1824.</p>

            <h2>CLIMATE</h2>
            <p>Mexico City has a subtropical highland climate, due to its tropical location and high elevation.
            <p>The average annual temperature varies from 54 to 61F, depending on the altitude of the borough. The temperature is rarely below 37F or above 86F.</p>

            <h2>NEIGHBORHOODS</h2>
            <p>The boroughs are composed by hundreds of colonias or neighborhoods, which have no jurisdictional autonomy or representation. The Historic Center is the oldest part of the city (along with some other, formerly separate colonial towns such as Coyoacan and San √Ångel), some of the buildings dating back to the 16th century.</p>
