  <h1>DF's NEIGHBORHOODS</h1>
  <div class="row">

      <ul>
        <li class="highlight">CENTRAL</li>
      <p>Other well-known central neighborhoods include Condesa, known for its Art Deco architecture and its restaurant scene; Colonia Roma, a beaux arts neighborhood and artistic and culinary hot-spot, the Zona Rosa, formerly the center of nightlife and restaurants, now reborn as the center of the LGBT and Korean-Mexican communities; and Tepito and La Lagunilla, known for their local working-class foklore and large flea markets.</p>

    <div class="col-md-4">
        <li class="highlight">WEST</li>
      <p>West of the Historic Center (Centro Historico) along Paseo de la Reforma are many of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods such as Polanco, Lomas de Chapultepec, Bosques de las Lomas, Santa Fe, and (in the State of Mexico) Interlomas, which are also the city's most important areas of class A office space, corporate headquarters, skyscrapers and shopping malls. Nevertheless, areas of lower income colonias exist in some cases cheek-by-jowl with rich neighborhoods, particularly in the case of Santa Fe.</p>

    <div class="col-md-8">
        <li class="highlight">SOUTH</li>
      <p>The south of the city is home to some other high-income neighborhoods such as Colonia del Valle and Jardines del Pedregal, and the formerly separate colonial towns of Coyoacan, San Angel, and San Jeronimo. Along Avenida Insurgentes from Paseo de la Reforma, near the center, south past the World Trade Center and UNAM University towards the Periferico ring road, is another important corridor of corporate office space. The far southern boroughs of Xochimilco and Tlahuac have a significant rural population with Milpa Alta being entirely rural.</p>

    <div class="col-md-4">
        <li class="highlight">EAST</li>
      <p>East of the center are mostly lower income areas with some middle-class neighborhoods such as Jard√≠n Balbuena.</p>

    <div class="col-md-8">
        <li class="highlight">NORTH</li>
      <p>North of the Historic Center, Azcapotzalco and Gustavo A. Madero have important industrial centers and neighborhoods that range from established middle-class colonias such as Claveria and Lindavista to huge low-income housing areas that share hillsides with adjacent municipalities in the State of Mexico.</p>
